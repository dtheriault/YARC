This repository is Public and contains files supporting talks given by NO1D at
various YARC meetings.

##Prototyping - Making PCB's in your Garage

First talk to YARC on how I make PCB's in my garage using the Toner Transfer
method.  Used ID Timer circuit as the example and handed out many to club
members.

##IDtimer -- Ham Identification Timer circuit 

Project was presented during an April 2016 talk on PCB Prototyping.  The ID
Circuit was used as an example of thru-hole and SMD PCB which was produced for
club members using the Toner Transfer method. ID Timer provides 2m, 3m, 5m,
10m or 15m timer functions.  Software written for ATtiny85 however can be used
on variety of other Arduino/AVR based chips with minor modifications.
Hardware files for the ID Circuit are Eagle v7.2 based and can be used to
print your own PCB's.

##Spotting -- Spotting/Skimming using SDR's

Talk was given at the June 2016 Hamfest at Embry Riddle University.  Presented
my experiences using RTLSDR and Hermes Lite SDR's as skimmers for CW, RTTY and
WSPR/JT9/JT65 modes.
