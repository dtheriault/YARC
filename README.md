##IDtimer -- Ham Identification Timer circuit 

  Project was presented during an April 2016 talk on PCB Prototyping.  The ID Circuit was used
  as an example of thru-hole and SMD PCB which was produced for club members using the Toner Transfer 
  method. ID Timer provides 2m, 3m, 5m or 10m timer functions.  Software written for ATtiny85 however
  can be used on variety of other Arduino/AVR based chips with minor modifications.  Hardware files 
  for the ID Circuit are Eagle v7.2 based and can be used to print your own PCB's.
